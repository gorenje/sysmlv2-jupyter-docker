# SysML v2 Jupyter Book
SysML v2 explorations with Jupyter

The SysML v2 Jupyter Book explores the new features of SysML v2 in application.

The Jupyter notebook shows SysML v2 in application with a special focus on the differences to SysML v1 and first derivations of good practices. It does not currently have the purpose of fully explaining SysML v2.

To view the SysML v2 Jupyter Book open the Jupyter notebook file with nbviewer: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MBSE4U/SysMLv2JupyterBook/blob/master/SysMLv2JupyterBook.ipynb

You need a SysML v2 Jupyter notebook environment with a SysML v2 kernel to run the SysML v2 models in the book yourself.
